Hello Git and GitHub
This is a program I am working on as a way to get aquanted with git bash and git hub 
the plan is to make a program that uses arrays and text based options to run a small invintory system to also learn more about c# 

I will also be adding a GUI as i work on figuring out how to build one lol
